        <p> My name is Caitlin Coffey and I am 19 years old. I am a sophomore at the University of Rhode  <br>
         Island planning on double majoring in Computer Science and Criminal Justice. I am planning on <br>
         getting my masters in Cybersecurity and working for a Federal Agency. Currently I am on my <br>
         dance studios competition team and I am about to start my last competition season with them <br>
         My dad and I watch as much college basketball as we can that is why we love URI because we <br>
         can watch all of Rhodys games. I love traveling, especially to New York because there are <br>
         always things to do there. I also work for Miss New York USA, Miss New Jersey USA, and Miss <br>
         Rhode Island USA pageant and we just finished our last state of the year. <br>
