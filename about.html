        <p> My name is Caitlin Coffey and I am 20 years old. I am a sophmore/junior at the University of Rhode  <br>
         Island planning on double majoring in Computer Science and Criminal Justice and minoring in Political Science.</br>
         I am planning on getting my masters in Cybersecurity at Boston University </br>
         and working for a Federal Agency hopefully the FBI. Currently I am on my <br>
         dance studios competition team and I am about to do another competition season with them <br>
         My dad and I watch as much college basketball as we can that is why we love URI because we <br>
         can watch all of Rhodys games. I love traveling, especially to New York because there are <br>
         always things to do there. I also work for Miss New York USA, Miss New Jersey USA, and Miss <br>
         Rhode Island USA pageant and we just finished our last state of the year. <br>
