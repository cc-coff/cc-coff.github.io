         University of Rhode Island majoring in Computer Science or possibly Buisness. I am a transfer student from <br>
         Rhode Island College. I am a dancer and am currently on my dance studios competition and also I am apart <br>
         of the Dance Company here at URI. I love to travel especially to New York and hope to work there in the future <br>
