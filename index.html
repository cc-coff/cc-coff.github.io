      <h1> Welcome to Caitlin's Programming Portfolio</h1>
 <p> My name is Caitlin and this is my website on programs for the CSC106 the Joy of Programming course. I wrote page myself
             using the HTML language. The Apps link above has apps that I have written that work
             on your phone. The Javascripts link above has Javascrpits that I have written to be 
             used in web pages. The about me link above is more information about myself. </p>
